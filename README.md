# usda-hpai-2022-confirmed-detections
This repository houses data collected by the USDA identifying confirmed detections of HPAI 2022 in American poultry.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture tracks confirmed detections of HPAI 2022/2023 in commercial and backyard flocks. They publish these data in a Tableau-based dashboard accessible here: https://publicdashboards.dl.usda.gov/t/MRP_PUB/views/VS_Avian_HPAIConfirmedDetections2022/HPAI2022ConfirmedDetections (and iframed into a a [webpage](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks)).

Harvesting these data in an automated way from the Tableau dashboard is annoying, so I'm mirroring the data in a simple CSV flatfile here.

These data drive a data visualization of the bird flu infections at https://www.willkoeppen.com/datavis/bird-flu/.
